Quantitative Variables: are the characteristics that can be measured on a quantitative scale, that is, they have numerical values ​​that make sense. They can be continuous or discrete.

Discrete variables: measurable characteristics that can take on only a finite or infinite number of values ​​and thus only make whole values ​​meaningful. They are usually the result of counts. Examples: number of children, number of bacteria per liter of milk, number of cigarettes smoked per day.

Continuous variables, measurable characteristics that take values ​​on a continuous scale (on the real line), for which fractional values ​​make sense. Usually they should be measured by some instrument. Examples: weight (balance), height (ruler), time (clock), blood pressure, age.

Qualitative (or categorical) variables: these are the characteristics that do not have quantitative values, but, instead, are defined by several categories, that is, they represent a classification of individuals. They can be nominal or ordinal.

Nominal variables: there is no ordering among categories. Examples: sex, eye color, smoker / non-smoker, sick / healthy.

Ordinal variables: there is an ordering between categories. Examples: schooling (1st, 2nd, 3rd grades), stage of illness (initial, intermediate, terminal), month of observation (January, February, ..., December).
